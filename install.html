            <h1>What is ADHD reader?</h1>
                ADHD reader is an extension that boldens the first half of every word. This allows people with certain neurodivergences such as ADHD and dyslexia read more easily. I am a student who made this in my spare time, so please forgive any issues you may encounter.
            <h1>How to use</h1>
                Using ADHD reader is very simple. Pin the extension to your browser's tool bar using the puzzle icon on the top right of your screen, to the right of the searchbar. From then on, click on the icon to turn the extension on and off. The icon should change depending on its status.
